-- General
Add buffer handling to prevent PHP getting overloaded and run out of memory
Integrate with drop-box for storing encrypted files
Full screen message (thread display) by default, user tests show that may cause the user to close the open message instead of the window, 
	their mouse will stop short, does this work on a Mac?
	Offer "Load more messages by this user" button
Move folder loading, message caching, account loading, loading contacts all in to a prioritized worker queue in javascript
	This should prioritize things the user clicks on higher than things loading in the background
	This will use the local database for storage, do as much processing as possible on the worker side
	Results will be displayed in a window queue.  It a user opens a new window for a message, it should display there instead of the main window, 
		contacts, folders, and keys can also be popped out in to a new window
Store password/salt for encrypted private keys on server, client requests then based on successful email login, 
	client ID is used to request session token,
		If computer is lost or stolen, the client id can be revoked,
		if the client ID is lost or stolen, do they need to import private keys again?
	server returns salts and a session token to be decrypted with private key, 
	salt and password are useless without the actual ammored key, client can be denied if it is has been disabled on the server
Support plugins by allowing a provider to send a link or Javascript content that is signed, verify the signature, 
	then eval inside a Worker to isolate access, only pass in certain data to the worker based on the plugin's state capabilities (inside the signature block, or some kind of header?)
	Can we be less strict on the content filtering because a plugin inside a Worker has less access to data?
	What if the plugin inserts javascript in to a link?
Pressing the Enter key in the login fields should activate login button, simple key handler
Offer to store settings/accounts with a master password, does Firefox master password encrypt localStorage data?
Handle smtp errors gracefully in send.php and worker.send.js
Fix copying style attribute from parent jqte_editor in jqte.js
Disguise public key generation and trust management as something simpler than it is now
  Or use Enigmail interface and jQuery DataGrid
FIX download to work with new callback scheme used in decrypt.
	Downloading an attachment should show progress bar
	In mail.php, get the structure of the email first, like imap_fetchstructure() but faster
	In mail.js, parseMime should function normally and when it gets to a large body part it displays a download link
Display message data from selected folder before loading body with callback, display loading symbol
Handle errors from callbacks gracefully
Compose mail, using drag and drop events to read file, get attachments working
Colorize message replies like thunderbird does.
Abstract by extending objects, a cross between jQuery and C# extension methods.
	Each .php file can hosts its own javascript instead of nav.js doing most of the work
Write a suite of unit tests for e-mail edge cases and poor formatting added by multiple relays
Cache emails locally
Implement a spam filter using spam bayes and signatures shared with the server.
  When spam hits a certain threashold, there must be some amount of information that is safe to share
Display an icon indicating trust levels along the left side of the emails
Generate revocation certificates by default and notify users when they are revoked
Implement search as you type using file database locally.
  Perform a server search when you click the button or press ENTER key.
Synchronize settings by encrypting using temporary key and 
  uploading to server, it is deleted when client receives it
  Just like Firefox, the keys are only known to the client
Support signatures in text form and encrypted form, find how to do both but display it as one
Does using a Worker for decryption have any problems with copying large files?
Offer <name>@fumail.me email addresses.
Use node.js and MongoDB to store e-mail data and cache email
Use a server with lots of temporary memory and bandwidth to provide a proxy for email servers
Build a social network on trust
SMTP protocol should not fail after just entering a username, this allows brute force attacks to be narrowed (see OWASP),
  propose specification update

----------------------OAuth/OpenID---------------------------------
Implement http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871 DKIM-Signature
Implement http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5751 S/MIME
Manage public keys and contacts
Use OAuth to authenticate to services
	Can we make every client an OAuth server?  FuMail server asks the client for permission to relay for/represent them, 
		we receive a token from every user used to identify/track usage/pay yearly membership for the session
Use OpenID instead
Use public and private key to authenticate no need to store the password
  When a user logs in, request a session from the server
  The server encrypts with their public key, the client decrypts message with private key
  The client sends message back to server to authenticate
	Use private keys on client to decrypt session for each public key that the server thinks belongs to the client, 
		one session key per public/private key, if it is successfully decrypted then log usage for billing on encrypted send
When private key is lost or stolen, clients can be deauthenticated, and even kill switched
  This may align better with OpenID capabilities
