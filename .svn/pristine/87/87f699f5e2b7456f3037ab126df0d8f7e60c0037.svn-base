<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<div style="overflow:auto; height:300px;">
<p>Thanks to advances in web technology, new HTML 5 standards specify how data can be stored in a web browser.  This gives our browsers a whole new field of exciting applications.  In particular an application for creating secure, ecrypted e-mail.</p>
<p>When you sign up you enter a password and a reset key.  The password and reset key are hashed and sent to our servers for account management.  Your reset key-hash and the hashed password are stored in our database.</p>
<p>A certificate public/private key pair is created.  The private key is stored in a local store inside your web browser, with the recommendation it be backed up BY YOU.</p>
<p>Your public key is uploaded and stored on our server, for contact management purposes.</p>
<h3>When you write an e-mail:</h3>
<p>When you write a new e-mail all participants in the e-mail are analyzed to determine a security level.  If no secure relationship has been established, you will be notified immediately.</p>
<p>If you prefer to send the e-mail anyways, without any encryption, the participant is checked for Secure Post.  Secure Post is a standard which allows SMTP (out-going mail) to be encrypted over SSL.  This prevents a man in the middle attack between our servers and the receiving end.  If no Secure Post can be detected, you will be notified immediately.</p>
<p>If a secure relationship has been set up with a contact, the e-mail is encrypted with their public key (stored on our server, or stored in your local store).  The e-mail is encrypted client side; that is no readable information is ever sent to our servers.  The encrypted package is uploaded, the recipients of the e-mail and the subject are added to the envelope and the e-mail is sent with full PGP encryption support.</p>
<h3>How to set up a secure relationship:</h3>
<p>Setting up a secure relationship is simple, and can be done in various ways.  You and your friend use another medium (such as Facebook or a flash-drive) to exchange an encryption key, basically a simple password like &ldquo;aardvark&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You both enter the password in to your browser.  Your public key is attached as a zip with the password you agreed on.  Our service delivers the zipped e-mail just like any other normal e-mail.</p>
<p>When you receive each others public keys over e-mail, you enter your password you agreed on earlier.  If the transfer is successful, the zip file will be decrypted and you can store the public key in the contact manager.  From that point on, the public key is used to encrypt all messages between you and your friend.</p>
<p>Text message and instant message can also be used to agree on a password.  Public keys can be exchanged at any time, over any medium.  They can always be added to the contact manager; as long as you trust the person it came from.</p>
<h3>Setting up FUMAIL on multiple devices is easy:</h3>
<p>Just copy your web-browsers local store, or backup your private key and transfer it to your other device.</p>
<h3>Copying public keys is easy:</h3>
<p>Backup your public key store, or use our contact manager to keep track of public keys.</p>
<h3>Revoking your public key:</h3>
<p>If your public key is lost or stolen (for example, you accidently send it to a spammer), you may revoke your public key.  Our servers will notify your friends that your public key has been revoked.  You will be notified any time you get an e-mail encrypted with your expired public keys.</p>
<p>When you create a new public key, you can re-establish your trusted connection with whichever friends you like.</p>
<h3>What if you lose or forget your password?</h3>
<p>If accounts are compromised, your password can be reset using your reset key; the same process that takes place if you lose or forget your password.  Simply enter your reset key, and receive a text or e-mail with the confirmation code.  Enter the confirmation code and your password can be changed.</p>
<p>If your public key falls in to the wrong hands, simply generate a new one.  All users with your last key will be warned that your key has changed.  You must choose who to send your newly established public key to.</p>
<p>If you lose your private key, your e-mails can be recovered from your local store.  There is no way for you to recover e-mails from our servers without your private key.  Your private key is very important, and it is your responsibility to keep it safe.</p>
<h3>If you don’t read my e-mail, how do I search?</h3>
<p>When the e-mail reaches your web-browser on your local computer, our offline mail client searches for unique strings and subjects inside the e-mail.  These key words can be many or few based on your preference.  Search tags can be added by you at any time to an e-mail.  These tags are hashed and uploaded to our servers where they are stored for later use.</p>
<p>When you perform a search, we add in all the synonyms of words you used, hash the words, then search your database of hashes for the search term.  You can always search your local storage for the search term, in addition to the search hashes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">NO SPAM, NO UNWANTED E-MAILS,<br /> COMPLETELY SECURE END-TO-END</h2>
<p>Features are split in to two categories of privacy and security shown below:</p>

<tr>
<td>Storing your private key</td>
<td colspan="2">That is entirely your responsibility.  Our servers NEVER see your private key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Storing your friends public keys</td>
<td>Using our contact manager.  Public keys are intended to be public, if someone mistakenly gets ahold of it, it isn't the end of the world.</td>
<td>Using your private key store.  Your local store can hold a few keys, keys can always be backed-up, restored, and reloaded, when you go to send e-mails.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tr>
<td>Backing up keys and recovery</td>
<td colspan="2">Weather the key is stored in our contact manager or your private keys and friend’s keys are stored in your local store, you ALWAYS have the option to backup.  The keys are nicely packaged in to a zip file and can be saved anywhere you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Search my e-mails</td>
<td>The subject line can always be searched.  In addition, you can set up terms for each e-mail which can be searched later.</td>
<td rowspan="2">Searching your local store is always an option; e-mails must be downloaded locally for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Advanced search</td>
<td>For advanced searching, your e-mail can be copied to temporary memory, your private key uploaded to our temporary storage, and search queries can be run.  When you are done searching, or after 15 minutes of inactivity, or when you log out, the temporary store is completely erased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I forget my password</td>
<td>When you forget your password, your reset key can be used to reset your account, your public keys and your e-mails are completely recoverable, as long as you have your private key stored on your local hard drive.</td>
<td>You can use your reset key to reset your password, your e-mail is downloaded to your local store, your public keys are not recovered and you must re-establish trust with your friends.  You can never recover your private key from anywhere but your local store.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client access</td>
<td colspan="2">You can always use Outlook or Thunderbird.  Outlook uses S/MIME, with the small difference that you trust our service as the certificate authority.  We promise not to violate your trust.<br />
For unencrypted e-mail you can use your Secure Post and Secure IMAP server to access your e-mail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Running your own server</td>
<td colspan="2">We will use Secure Post whenever possible to deliver e-mail.  If you prefer to use your own e-mail server, you are welcome to do so.  Our web-based software is completely free; you can download and serve the pages just like you would a website.  We use zero obfuscation and we have nothing to hide.</td>
