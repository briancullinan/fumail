Added a workQueue to queue web Workers to perform very specific tasks,
	This fixes the issue with the loading bars disappear at different times, now the queue is checked for all work to be completed before remove the loading symbol
	This could be prioritized easily, so user initiated actions come before background work
	This will be extended to support loading all e-mails in the background and storing them in a local database, but the spec isn't completely implemented
